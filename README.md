## ⭐ My Best Projects (for now)


🔹 ![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3776AB?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=white)   **OoniquePass (https://www.github.com/ryanhenrqq/OoniquePass)**  
OoniquePass is a project whose main function is to generate a unique and strong password for various uses. OoniquePass can generate passwords using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. This code is written in Python, using an external library called TkInter for graphical window rendering.


🔹 ![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=000)   **FloodTheCookie (https://www.github.com/ryanhenrqq/FloodTheCookie)**  
This is my favorite project (for being my ambitious project), focused on being a click-to-earn game with strong visual appeal, intuitive menus with blur effects, and a playful way to pass the time. Written in **JavaScript, CSS & HTML**, it has a strong focus on scripting.
